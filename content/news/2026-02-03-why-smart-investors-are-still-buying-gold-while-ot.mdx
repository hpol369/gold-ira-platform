The financial media is buzzing with a question that tells you everything about how little most people understand real money: "Do investors even need to own gold and silver anymore?"

This question is being asked just as precious metals appear to be bottoming out after months of decline. The so-called "experts" are suggesting that maybe, just maybe, gold and silver have lost their relevance in today's digital economy.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the mainstream won't tell you: **The very fact that this question is being asked tells you it's time to pay attention to gold and silver.**

When everyone is questioning an asset class that has preserved wealth for over 5,000 years, that's usually when the smart money starts accumulating. I've been saying this for years - the best time to buy assets is when everyone else is selling or ignoring them.

The financial media wants you focused on their volatility, not their purpose. **Gold and silver aren't investments - they're insurance against the systematic destruction of your purchasing power.** While the Fed continues printing dollars like there's no tomorrow, precious metals remain real money backed by nothing but their inherent scarcity and 5,000 years of human history.

Follow the money, people. Central banks around the world have been accumulating gold at record levels. China, Russia, and other nations are buying gold hand over fist. Do you think they're doing this because gold is irrelevant? Wake up. They know what's coming.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with your retirement savings sitting in traditional 401(k)s and IRAs, this "gold skepticism" should be a massive red flag.

Your retirement account, stuffed with stocks and bonds denominated in dollars, is essentially a bet that the dollar will maintain its value over the next 10-20 years. But here's the reality: **the dollar has lost over 95% of its purchasing power since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.** That process is accelerating, not slowing down.

Consider this: if you had $100,000 in retirement savings 20 years ago and kept it in cash, you'd need about $165,000 today just to have the same purchasing power. That's inflation eating your wealth alive, and it's getting worse, not better.

## What You Should Do

This is exactly why financial education matters. While others are asking whether gold and silver are still relevant, you should be asking how much of your retirement portfolio should be protected with real assets.

**The rich already know this secret: diversification isn't just about different stocks and bonds - it's about different types of money.** Fiat currency, real estate, precious metals, and other tangible assets that can't be printed into existence.

Don't let the mainstream media's gold skepticism fool you. When everyone is zigging, the wealthy zag. Consider protecting a portion of your retirement savings with assets that have maintained their value throughout history.

If you're serious about protecting your retirement from currency debasement, it might be time to learn about Gold IRAs and how to move some of your traditional retirement funds into real money that central banks can't print away.
