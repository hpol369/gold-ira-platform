Mortgage and refinance rates are dropping in response to the latest jobs report, and the mainstream media is celebrating like it's Christmas morning. **But here's what they won't tell you: every time rates drop, your dollar gets weaker.**

The Federal Reserve's constant rate manipulation isn't about helping homebuyers - it's about keeping the debt machine running. And guess who pays the price? Anyone holding cash or traditional retirement accounts.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

I've been saying this for years: **the Fed's policies are designed to transfer wealth from savers to borrowers.** When mortgage rates drop, it's not because the economy is strong. It's because the Fed is manipulating interest rates to keep the debt bubble inflated.

Here's the real game being played. Lower rates mean more money printing. More money printing means dollar devaluation. Dollar devaluation means your retirement savings lose purchasing power every single day.

**The rich already know this.** While ordinary Americans get excited about lower mortgage rates, wealthy investors are buying real assets - gold, silver, real estate, businesses. They understand that in a world of fake money, you need real assets to preserve wealth.

Follow the money, people. The same system that's dropping mortgage rates is the same system that's been stealing your purchasing power for decades through inflation. This isn't coincidence - it's policy.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you've got money sitting in a traditional savings account earning 2-3% while real inflation runs 6-8%, **you're getting crushed.** Those dropping mortgage rates that everyone's celebrating? They're a symptom of the same disease that's eating your retirement alive.

Let's get specific. Say you've got $500,000 in your 401(k) invested in bonds and CDs. With real inflation running hot and the Fed playing rate games, that money is losing 4-5% of its purchasing power annually. That's $20,000-25,000 per year in buying power - gone.

**This is why savers are losers in today's rigged system.** The Fed's policies reward debtors and punish savers. If you're approaching retirement or already retired, you can't afford to play by their rules.

## What You Should Do

Stop thinking like poor dad - "save money in the bank and everything will be fine." Start thinking like rich dad - **buy assets that hold their value when dollars lose theirs.**

The wealthy don't keep all their wealth in paper assets that can be devalued by Fed policy. They diversify into real money - gold and silver - that has preserved purchasing power for thousands of years.

**This is why financial education matters.** The system is designed to keep you confused while your wealth gets transferred to those who understand the game. Don't let dropping mortgage rates distract you from the bigger picture: your dollar is under attack.

Consider diversifying part of your retirement portfolio into precious metals through a Gold IRA. While the Fed plays games with interest rates, gold and silver maintain their purchasing power. It's not about getting rich quick - it's about not getting poor slowly.

Wake up, people. The mortgage rate headlines are noise. The real story is dollar devaluation, and you need real assets to protect yourself.
