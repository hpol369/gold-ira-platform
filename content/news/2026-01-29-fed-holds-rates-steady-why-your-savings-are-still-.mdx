The Federal Reserve announced they're keeping interest rates steady at their latest meeting, leaving the federal funds rate in the 5.25% to 5.50% range. Fed Chair Powell cited "progress" on inflation and concerns about the job market as reasons for the pause.

Wall Street cheered the news, with markets rallying on hopes that rate hikes are done. The mainstream financial media is spinning this as good news for consumers and retirees.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

**Here's what they're not telling you:** Keeping rates "steady" is just another way of saying they're continuing to manipulate the economy through artificial interest rates.

I've been saying this for years - the Fed doesn't work for you. They work for the big banks and the government that needs to keep borrowing money to fund endless spending. When they hold rates at these levels, they're walking a tightrope between trying to control inflation and keeping the debt bubble from popping.

**The rich already know this secret:** Real interest rates are what matter, not nominal rates. With inflation still running hot in groceries, energy, and housing - the things you actually buy - your purchasing power continues to erode. A 5% interest rate sounds good until you realize your cost of living is rising faster than that.

Follow the money, and you'll see the real game. The Fed has printed over $5 trillion since 2020. That money doesn't just disappear because they pause rate hikes. It's still sloshing around the system, devaluing every dollar in your wallet and every dollar in your retirement account.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money sitting in "safe" savings accounts or CDs, you're getting crushed. Even at today's rates, you're barely keeping up with official inflation numbers - and we all know those numbers don't reflect what you're paying at the grocery store or gas pump.

**Your 401(k) and IRA are sitting ducks.** When the Fed eventually has to choose between fighting inflation and saving the financial system, guess which one they'll pick? They'll print money to save the banks, just like they did in 2008 and 2020. Your paper assets - stocks, bonds, and cash - will pay the price.

This is why financial education matters. While everyone else celebrates "steady rates," smart money is moving into real assets that have protected wealth for thousands of years.

## What You Should Do

**Don't fall for the mainstream narrative that this is good news.** The Fed pause doesn't mean your money is safe - it means they're trapped between bad options and worse options.

This is the time to diversify into assets that can't be printed into existence. Gold and silver have been real money for 5,000 years. They've survived every currency collapse, every market crash, and every government that thought it could print its way to prosperity.

Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into a Gold IRA. You can roll over funds from your existing 401(k) or IRA without tax penalties, and you'll own physical precious metals that no central bank can devalue with a printing press.

**The wealthy have been doing this for decades.** They understand that in a world of fake money, you need real assets. Don't wait until the next crisis to learn this lesson the hard way.

Your retirement is too important to leave in the hands of the Fed and their Wall Street friends. Take control while you still can.
