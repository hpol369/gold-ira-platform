MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor made headlines this week by doubling down on his bitcoin strategy, even as the cryptocurrency faces mounting pressure. When asked about the possibility of bitcoin falling to $8,000 – a drop of roughly 85% from current levels – **Saylor didn't blink. He won't sell.**

This isn't just corporate bravado. MicroStrategy has loaded up on over 190,000 bitcoins, making it one of the largest corporate holders in the world. With bitcoin's recent volatility, some investors are questioning whether the company might be forced to liquidate. Saylor's answer was clear: not happening.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media is missing: **Saylor understands something most people don't – we're in a currency war.**

The mainstream wants you to focus on bitcoin's price swings. They'll show you scary charts and talk about "risk management." But they won't tell you why billionaires like Saylor are buying bitcoin in the first place. It's not about getting rich quick – it's about **getting out of a system designed to make you poor.**

I've been saying this for years: **the dollar is being systematically destroyed.** The Fed has printed trillions of dollars since 2020. Every new dollar printed makes your savings worth less. Saylor gets this. That's why he's converted his company's treasury from dollars to bitcoin.

The rich already know this secret. While regular Americans keep their retirement savings in 401(k)s filled with paper assets, the wealthy are moving into hard assets. Bitcoin, gold, silver, real estate – these are stores of value that can't be printed into oblivion.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older, Saylor's bitcoin bet should wake you up to a harsh reality: **your retirement savings are under attack.**

Think about it. You've spent decades saving dollars in your 401(k) or IRA. But what happens when those dollars buy less and less each year? The government calls it "moderate inflation." I call it theft.

Here's a concrete example: If you have $500,000 in retirement savings and inflation runs at 6% annually, you lose $30,000 in purchasing power every single year. That's real money disappearing from your retirement – and there's nothing your financial advisor can do to stop it.

**Saylor's willingness to hold bitcoin through an 85% crash tells you everything.** He'd rather own a volatile digital asset than a currency being systematically devalued by central bankers. That should tell you something about what he thinks is coming for the dollar.

## What You Should Do

Don't panic about bitcoin's volatility – that's missing the point. The real lesson from Saylor's strategy is this: **you need to own assets that can't be printed.**

Bitcoin might be too volatile for your retirement portfolio, especially if you're nearing or in retirement. But the principle remains the same: get out of paper assets that can be devalued by government policy.

**Gold and silver have been real money for 5,000 years.** They can't be printed, hacked, or manipulated like digital currencies. They've preserved wealth through every currency crisis in history.

Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into a Gold IRA. Unlike bitcoin, precious metals offer stability without the extreme volatility. But like bitcoin, they're real assets that maintain their value when paper money fails.

**The time to diversify is now, while you still can.** Don't wait for the next crisis to realize that all your "safe" investments are denominated in a currency under attack.
