Kevin Hassett, Trump's National Economic Council director, just gave his blessing to Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Hassett called it Warsh's "dream job" and praised the pick despite once being considered the frontrunner himself.

Warsh, a former Fed governor who served during the 2008 financial crisis, is now positioned to lead the central bank that controls America's money supply. **The mainstream media is treating this like typical Washington musical chairs. But there's a much bigger story here.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what I've been saying for years: **it doesn't matter who sits in the Fed chair**. The game stays the same.

The Federal Reserve exists to serve two masters - Wall Street and the government. Whether it's Powell, Yellen, Bernanke, or now potentially Warsh, they all play by the same playbook: print money, keep interest rates artificially low, and transfer wealth from savers to borrowers.

Warsh was there during 2008 when the Fed printed trillions to bail out the banks. He watched them create money out of thin air while regular Americans lost their homes and retirement savings. **The rich got richer, and Main Street got poorer.** Sound familiar?

Follow the money, people. Hassett praising this pick tells you everything. The establishment wants someone who understands "the game" - someone who will keep the money printing going when the next crisis hits. And trust me, there will be a next crisis.

The Fed has painted itself into a corner with decades of easy money policy. **They can't raise rates without crashing the economy, and they can't keep them low without destroying the dollar.** Whoever takes this job inherits an impossible situation.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're sitting on cash or traditional retirement accounts, you're about to get hit from both sides.

**First, your purchasing power continues to erode.** The Fed's own target is 2% inflation - meaning they want your money to lose value every single year. But real inflation (the stuff you actually buy) has been running much higher. Your $100,000 in savings today will buy what $95,000 bought last year.

**Second, the bond portion of your 401(k) is a ticking time bomb.** When interest rates eventually rise (and they will), bond values crash. The "safe" part of your retirement portfolio becomes the most dangerous part.

Here's the math they don't want you to see: If you're earning 1% on your savings and inflation is running at 3%, **you're losing 2% of your purchasing power every year.** Over 10 years, that's 20% of your wealth - gone.

## What You Should Do

This is why financial education matters more than ever. **Stop thinking like a saver and start thinking like an investor.**

The rich aren't keeping their wealth in dollars. They're buying real assets - gold, silver, real estate, and businesses that can raise prices with inflation. They understand that cash is trash in an inflationary environment.

**Get educated about precious metals.** Gold has been real money for 5,000 years. It's survived every currency collapse, every Fed chairman, and every financial crisis. While the Fed debates policy, gold just protects purchasing power.

Consider diversifying part of your retirement savings into physical gold and silver through a precious metals IRA. It's one of the few ways to protect your wealth from the Fed's money printing games.

The monetary musical chairs will continue. The faces change, but the game stays rigged against savers. **Don't be a victim of their policies. Take control of your financial education and protect your retirement with real assets.**
