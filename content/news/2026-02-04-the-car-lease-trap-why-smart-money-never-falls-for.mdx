A smart 16-year-old recently asked a question that stumped adults: "Why would anyone lease a car? What's the point of paying thousands of dollars and having nothing to show for it?"

**Out of the mouths of babes.** This teenager just identified one of the biggest wealth destroyers in America - and most adults can't even see it.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what your banker, car dealer, and financial advisor won't explain: **Car leases are designed to keep you poor.**

The car industry has perfected the art of making liabilities look like assets. They dangle low monthly payments in front of cash-strapped Americans, knowing most people only think about monthly cash flow, not wealth building.

**Follow the money.** Who benefits from leases? The car companies, banks, and dealerships - not you. They get guaranteed monthly payments, keep ownership of a depreciating asset, and ensure you'll be back in three years for another lease. It's a subscription model for cars, and you're the product being sold.

I've been saying this for years: **The rich buy assets that put money in their pockets. The poor and middle class buy liabilities that take money out.** A car lease is the perfect example. You're paying someone else's car loan while they keep the asset.

The mainstream financial media won't tell you this because car companies are major advertisers. Wake up, people - the system is rigged to extract wealth from working Americans.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

Every dollar you waste on car leases is a dollar that's not building your retirement wealth. Let me show you the real cost.

**The typical American leases a new car every three years at $400 per month.** That's $14,400 over three years with zero equity built. Do this for 30 years (age 35 to 65), and you've thrown away $144,000 - money that could have been invested in real assets.

But here's where it gets worse. **If you invested that $400 monthly in assets earning 7% annually, you'd have over $400,000 by retirement.** Instead, you have nothing but a stack of lease agreements and the privilege of making payments forever.

This is exactly how the financial system keeps Americans broke. They convince you to lease cars, carry credit card debt, and keep your retirement money in 401(k)s that can disappear when the next crash hits.

## What You Should Do

**Stop the wealth bleeding immediately.** Buy reliable used cars with cash or short-term financing. Drive them until they die. Redirect every dollar you would have wasted on lease payments into real assets.

Here's what smart money does: They buy depreciating assets (like cars) as cheaply as possible and invest the savings in appreciating assets like precious metals, real estate, or businesses.

**This is why financial education matters.** The rich understand the difference between assets and liabilities. They never lease cars because they know it's financial suicide.

If you're currently leasing, finish your contract and never do it again. Take the money you're burning on lease payments and consider diversifying into real assets that have held value for thousands of years - like gold and silver.

Your retirement depends on making smart decisions about every dollar. **Don't let car dealers steal your golden years with their payment plans.**
