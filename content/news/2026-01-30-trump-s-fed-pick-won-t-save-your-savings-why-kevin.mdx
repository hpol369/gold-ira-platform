President Trump announced Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair, and guess what happened to mortgage rates? Absolutely nothing.

The markets shrugged. Rates stayed put. **And that tells you everything you need to know about how rigged this game really is.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media won't explain: **It doesn't matter who sits in the Fed chair because the system itself is broken.**

Whether it's Jerome Powell, Kevin Warsh, or anyone else, they're all playing the same game. Print money. Keep rates artificially low. Bail out Wall Street when things go sideways. And stick Main Street with the bill through inflation.

I've been saying this for years - **the Fed isn't working for you.** They're working for the banks, the government, and the asset class that benefits from cheap money. Every time they fire up the printing presses, your purchasing power gets destroyed.

Warsh might talk a good game about being more "hawkish" on inflation. But when push comes to shove, do you really think any Fed chair is going to let the stock market crash or allow the government to default on its debt? Wake up, people. **The money printing will continue because it has to.**

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're sitting on a traditional retirement account stuffed with bonds and cash, you're getting crushed - and a new Fed chair won't change that.

Let's do the math. With real inflation running much higher than the official numbers, your "safe" 4% bond yield is actually losing you money every year. **Your purchasing power is evaporating while you sleep.**

Here's the kicker: Whether mortgage rates are 6% or 7% doesn't matter if the dollar in your pocket buys 20% less than it did five years ago. The rich already know this. They're not worried about mortgage rates - they're worried about currency debasement.

**This is why savers are losers in this system.** The game is rigged against anyone trying to build wealth through traditional savings and investment vehicles.

## What You Should Do

Don't wait for a new Fed chair to fix your retirement strategy. The system won't change, so you need to change your approach.

**Start moving your wealth into real assets.** Gold and silver have been real money for thousands of years - long before the Fed existed and long after it's gone. While politicians and central bankers can print dollars, they can't print precious metals.

The wealthy aren't keeping their wealth in dollars. They're buying assets that hold their value when currencies collapse. Real estate, commodities, and yes - gold and silver.

**This is why financial education matters more than ever.** Don't let the mainstream media convince you that a new Fed chair changes the fundamentals. The dollar is still being debased. Inflation is still eating your savings. And time is running out to protect what you've worked so hard to build.

If you're serious about protecting your retirement, consider diversifying into precious metals through a Gold IRA. It's one of the few ways to get real assets into your retirement account while the window is still open.
