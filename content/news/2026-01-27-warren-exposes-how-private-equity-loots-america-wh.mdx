Senator Elizabeth Warren just said what many of us have been thinking for years: **Private equity firms are financial parasites that "gut everything" they touch**.

From beloved retailers like Toys R Us and Kmart to essential services like hospitals and prisons, these Wall Street vultures swoop in, load companies with debt, strip out value, and walk away with "pockets stuffed with cash" while workers lose jobs and communities lose services.

Here's the playbook: Private equity buys a company using mostly borrowed money, saddles the target company with that debt, pays themselves massive "management fees," then either flips it or lets it collapse. **They win either way. The workers, customers, and communities? They get crushed.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what Warren didn't mention—and what the financial media conveniently ignores: **This entire racket is enabled by the Federal Reserve's money printing addiction.**

For over a decade, the Fed has kept interest rates artificially low, flooding the system with cheap money. Where does all that "liquidity" go? Straight into the hands of private equity firms and other Wall Street players who use it to buy up real assets—companies, real estate, anything tangible.

**This is the biggest wealth transfer in history, and it's happening right under our noses.**

The Fed creates money out of thin air, hands it to their Wall Street buddies at near-zero interest rates, and they use it to buy up America piece by piece. Meanwhile, your savings account earns 0.5% while inflation runs at 3-4%. **You're being robbed in broad daylight.**

I've been saying this for years: **The financial system is rigged against Main Street.** Private equity isn't some rogue element—it's the inevitable result of a monetary system that rewards debt and punishes savers.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you think your 401(k) or IRA is safe from this madness, think again.

Many retirement funds are **heavily invested in the same companies being gutted by private equity**. When Toys R Us collapsed, pension funds lost billions. When private equity strips value from healthcare companies, your retirement portfolio takes the hit while the PE firms collect their fees.

But here's the bigger threat: **The same cheap money policies that enable private equity are destroying the purchasing power of your retirement savings.** Every dollar the Fed prints makes your nest egg worth less in real terms.

Let's say you've got $500,000 in your 401(k) today. If inflation runs just 3% annually—and that's being conservative—you'll need $674,000 in ten years just to maintain the same purchasing power. **Your money is melting away while Wall Street gets richer.**

## What You Should Do

First, **get educated**. Understand that we're not in a normal economic environment. We're in the final stages of a monetary experiment that's enriching the asset-owning class while impoverishing savers and workers.

Second, **diversify out of paper assets**. The rich aren't keeping their wealth in dollars or even dollar-denominated assets. They're buying gold, silver, real estate—things that hold value when currencies collapse.

Warren is right to call out private equity, but she's missing the bigger picture. **This isn't about bad actors—it's about a broken monetary system that rewards speculation over production.**

Consider protecting a portion of your retirement with real assets like precious metals. Gold and silver have been money for thousands of years. They can't be printed, manipulated, or "managed" by bureaucrats who think they're smarter than markets.

**The wealthy already know this secret.** The question is: Will you learn it in time to protect your retirement, or will you be another casualty of the greatest wealth transfer in history?
