The Federal Reserve's leadership drama just got more interesting. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott announced Wednesday that he expects the Department of Justice will wrap up its criminal probe of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, clearing the path for President Trump's nominee Kevin Warsh to take over.

**Here's what's happening:** Powell is under DOJ investigation while Trump pushes for his replacement with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who served during the 2008 financial crisis. Scott believes once the probe concludes, Warsh's confirmation will move forward smoothly.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

**This is just another episode of Fed musical chairs** - and the song remains the same regardless of who's conducting.

Here's what the financial media won't explain: It doesn't matter if it's Powell, Warsh, or anyone else sitting in that chair. The Fed's playbook never changes. They print money, manipulate interest rates, and protect the big banks while your purchasing power gets destroyed.

I've been saying this for years - **the Fed exists to serve Wall Street, not Main Street.** Powell printed trillions during COVID. Before him, Yellen kept rates artificially low. Before her, Bernanke gave us quantitative easing. See the pattern?

Kevin Warsh was there during the 2008 crisis when the Fed bailed out the banks while regular Americans lost their homes. **The rich already know this:** Fed chairs are interchangeable parts in a machine designed to transfer wealth from savers to speculators.

Follow the money. Every Fed chair talks tough about fighting inflation, then turns around and enables more of it through money printing and rate manipulation.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

**Your retirement savings are caught in the crossfire** of this Fed leadership transition.

Whether it's Powell or Warsh, the playbook remains the same: keep the system afloat by devaluing your dollars. That $500,000 in your 401(k)? It's losing purchasing power every month the Fed keeps the money printers running.

**This is why savers are losers.** While you're earning 0.5% in your savings account, real inflation is eating 8-10% of your purchasing power annually. The Fed calls this "monetary policy." I call it legalized theft from retirees.

Think about it: If you had $100,000 in the bank when Powell started in 2018, that same money buys about $75,000 worth of goods today. The next Fed chair will continue this wealth destruction - it's baked into the system.

## What You Should Do

**Stop waiting for the Fed to protect your retirement** - they won't. Their job is to protect the banks and the government's ability to spend money they don't have.

**Diversify into real assets that have held value for thousands of years.** Gold and silver don't depend on Fed chairs or government promises. They've been real money long before the Fed existed and will be long after it's gone.

This is why financial education matters: **The wealthy don't keep all their money in dollars.** They own assets that maintain purchasing power regardless of who's running the Fed's money printing operation.

**Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into physical gold and silver** through a precious metals IRA. While Powell faces his probe and Warsh prepares for confirmation, your gold will be doing what it's done for centuries - preserving wealth against currency debasement.

Don't let Fed musical chairs play with your financial future.
