The Federal Open Market Committee just reaffirmed their "Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy" - the same framework they adopted in 2020 that targets **2% annual inflation** as "healthy" for the economy.

This isn't just bureaucratic paperwork. This is the Fed telling you, in writing, that they plan to **systematically reduce your dollar's purchasing power by 2% every single year**. And that's just their official target - we all know real inflation has been running much higher.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media won't explain: **This strategy is a wealth transfer mechanism disguised as monetary policy.**

When the Fed maintains their 2% inflation target, they're essentially saying your $100,000 retirement account should only buy $98,000 worth of goods next year. Every year. Forever. That's not monetary policy - that's legalized theft.

I've been saying this for years: **savers are losers in this system**. The Fed's "longer-run goals" prioritize Wall Street liquidity and government debt financing over your purchasing power. They need inflation to make the government's massive debt burden manageable, and they need low interest rates to keep the stock market bubble inflated.

The rich already know this. That's why they don't keep their wealth in dollars - they convert it into **real assets** that benefit from currency debasement. Real estate, stocks, commodities, precious metals. Assets that rise with inflation, not savings that get destroyed by it.

Follow the money: The same institutions that benefit from easy money policies are the ones telling you to "stay the course" with traditional retirement planning.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

Let's do the math your financial advisor won't show you. If you have $500,000 in retirement savings earning 1% in "safe" investments, but the Fed achieves their 2% inflation target, **you're losing $5,000 in purchasing power every year**.

That nest egg you've spent decades building? It's being systematically hollowed out by design. Your $500,000 today will have the purchasing power of roughly $410,000 in ten years - even if the account balance stays the same.

This is why financial education matters. The traditional retirement model assumes your dollars will maintain their value. **But the Fed just told you they won't.**

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. The Federal Reserve isn't your friend. They're not trying to protect your retirement - they're trying to manage a debt-based system that requires constant currency devaluation to survive.

**Diversification into real assets isn't optional anymore - it's essential.** You need to move at least a portion of your retirement savings into assets that maintain purchasing power when currencies lose value.

This is exactly why many Americans 55+ are exploring Gold IRAs and precious metals. Gold has been real money for 5,000 years. It's maintained purchasing power through every currency crisis, every monetary experiment, every "longer-run strategy" central banks have ever attempted.

You can't control Fed policy, but you can control how much of your wealth you keep exposed to their monetary experiments. **The question isn't whether the dollar will lose purchasing power - the Fed just confirmed it will. The question is what you're going to do about it.**

Don't let their "longer-run goals" become your short-term retirement disaster. Learn how Gold IRAs can help protect your purchasing power from the Fed's wealth transfer system.
