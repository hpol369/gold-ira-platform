FedEx just announced an ambitious 4-year strategy targeting **14% annual profit growth**. The shipping giant is betting big on higher prices, streamlined operations, and what they're calling "market optimization."

Here's the number that should wake you up: **14% growth in an economy where your savings account pays 0.5%**. While FedEx plans to extract more profits from an inflationary economy, your nest egg sits there losing purchasing power every single day.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

**The mainstream media celebrates corporate profit growth without asking the obvious question: where's that money coming from?**

It's coming from you. Every time the Fed prints trillions and devalues the dollar, corporations like FedEx can raise prices and call it "growth." They're not creating more value – they're collecting more devalued dollars for the same services.

I've been saying this for years: **inflation is the biggest wealth transfer in history, from savers to debtors, from Main Street to Wall Street**. FedEx's 14% growth target isn't a sign of economic strength. It's a symptom of currency debasement.

Here's what the rich already know that you don't: when corporations confidently project double-digit growth in a stagnant economy, they're positioning for inflation. They know something about the dollar's future that they're not sharing with you.

**Follow the money.** While FedEx prepares to profit from higher prices, your 401(k) filled with bonds and cash equivalents becomes worth less every month. The system is designed exactly this way.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55+ and holding traditional retirement assets, **you're on the wrong side of this wealth transfer**.

Let's do the math: If FedEx can confidently target 14% growth, real inflation is probably running much higher than the government's fake 3-4% numbers. Your savings account paying 0.5%? **You're losing 10-13% of your purchasing power annually**.

That $500,000 retirement nest egg you've worked decades to build? In four years, at true inflation rates, it might buy what $300,000 buys today. Meanwhile, corporations with pricing power and real assets will capture that lost value.

**This is why savers are losers.** The Fed has made it impossible to preserve wealth in traditional savings vehicles. They've forced you into a rigged game where the house always wins.

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. **Stop playing defense with your retirement and start playing offense.**

The rich don't keep their wealth in savings accounts or bond funds. They buy real assets – things that maintain purchasing power when currencies get debased. Gold, silver, real estate, and yes, even shares in companies like FedEx that can raise prices with inflation.

**This is why financial education matters more than ever.** You need to understand that your government and the Federal Reserve are not protecting your purchasing power. They're destroying it to benefit debtors and corporations.

Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into assets that have protected wealth for thousands of years. A Gold IRA lets you hold physical precious metals in your retirement account – real money that can't be printed into oblivion.

Don't trust the government with your retirement security. The same monetary policies that enable FedEx's profit projections are quietly confiscating your life savings through inflation.

**The choice is yours: keep playing their losing game, or start protecting your wealth the way the rich do.**
