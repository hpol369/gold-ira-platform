The Federal Reserve hit the pause button again, and predictably, home equity rates followed suit. **HELOC rates are holding steady around 7-8%, while home equity loans remain stuck in similar territory.** 

Most financial commentators are spinning this as "stability" or "wait-and-see wisdom." I've been watching the Fed for decades, and let me tell you - when they pause like this, it's not because everything is fine.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what's really happening: **The Fed is trapped.** They can't raise rates much higher without breaking the housing market and sending the economy into free fall. But they can't cut rates either without admitting that inflation is about to roar back.

So they're frozen. Paralyzed. And when the Fed is paralyzed, that tells you everything about the health of our financial system.

**Follow the money.** The government is still spending like a drunken sailor, which means more money printing is coming. The Fed knows this. Wall Street knows this. The only people who don't seem to know this are Main Street Americans who still think their savings accounts and 401(k)s will protect them.

I've been saying this for years: **when the Fed pauses, it's usually the calm before the storm.** They're buying time, hoping something magically fixes itself. But nothing is fixing itself - the debt keeps growing, the dollar keeps getting diluted, and your purchasing power keeps shrinking.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money sitting in traditional retirement accounts, this Fed pause should worry you more than rate hikes would.

**Here's why:** When rates eventually move again - and they will - it's going to be dramatic. Either they'll spike up to fight runaway inflation, crushing your bond values and stock portfolio. Or they'll crash down to zero to prevent economic collapse, destroying what's left of your savings' purchasing power.

Let's say you have $500,000 in your 401(k) right now. If we get another round of the money printing we saw during COVID, that half million might still show $500,000 on your statement. But what will it buy? Maybe what $300,000 buys today. **The number stays the same, but your wealth evaporates.**

This is the wealth transfer I've been warning about. Your hard-earned retirement savings get quietly confiscated through currency debasement while the government and Wall Street get bailed out with freshly printed dollars.

## What You Should Do

First, stop believing that this pause means everything is stable. **Stability would be the Fed actually shrinking their balance sheet and letting bad debt clear out of the system.** Instead, they're just kicking the can down the road.

Second, recognize that traditional retirement planning assumes a stable currency. That assumption is broken. The dollar of 2030 is going to buy a lot less than the dollar of 2024, no matter what your financial advisor tells you.

**This is why financial education matters more than ever.** The rich already know that real money - gold and silver - holds its value when fiat currencies get debased. They're not keeping their wealth in assets that can be printed into worthlessness.

Consider diversifying part of your retirement savings into precious metals through a Gold IRA. Not because gold always goes up, but because it's real money that can't be printed by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed's pause inevitably ends and the next crisis hits, you'll want some of your wealth in assets that have protected purchasing power for thousands of years.

The mainstream won't tell you this, but the wealthy have been moving into real assets for a reason. Don't wait until the next crisis hits to figure out why.
