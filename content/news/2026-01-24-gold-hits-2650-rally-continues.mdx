## What Happened

Gold prices touched $2,650 per ounce today, continuing a steady climb that has seen the precious metal gain over 15% in the past year. Trading volume remains elevated as both institutional and retail investors increase their gold allocations.

The World Gold Council reported that central bank gold purchases hit their highest levels since 1967, with China, Russia, and emerging market central banks leading the buying.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's something the financial media glosses over: **the people who print the money are buying gold**.

Think about that for a moment.

Central banks - the institutions that create fiat currency - are accumulating physical gold at the fastest pace in over 50 years. They're not buying stocks. They're not buying bonds. They're not buying crypto.

**They're buying the one asset they can't print.**

Why? Because they know better than anyone what they're doing to their own currencies. They know the end game of unlimited money printing. And they're positioning accordingly.

Meanwhile, Wall Street tells you to stay fully invested in stocks and bonds. They tell you gold is a "barbarous relic" that doesn't pay dividends.

But follow the money. Not the words - the actions. **Central banks are buying gold. Billionaires are buying gold.** Only the average investor is told to ignore it.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

The central banks buying gold aren't doing it for a quick trade. They're building reserves for the next monetary system - whatever that looks like.

Some economists predict a return to a gold-backed currency. Others see gold as the ultimate neutral reserve asset in a multipolar world. Either way, gold's role in the global financial system is expanding, not shrinking.

**For your retirement, this means gold isn't just an inflation hedge anymore.** It's positioning for a potential monetary reset.

If you have 100% of your retirement in dollar-denominated assets (stocks, bonds, cash), you're betting everything on the continued stability of the current system. The same system that has:

- Printed $8 trillion in the last few years
- Run up $34 trillion in national debt
- Created inflation that's crushing the middle class

## What You Should Do

You don't need to go all-in on gold. That's not what I'm suggesting.

But having **zero allocation to physical gold** when central banks are loading up? That's a risk most retirement savers can't afford to take.

A Gold IRA lets you hold physical gold in a tax-advantaged retirement account. Same tax benefits as your 401(k) or traditional IRA - but backed by an asset that has never gone to zero in 5,000 years of human history.

The window to position yourself may not stay open forever. When everyone finally realizes what's happening, gold will be much higher - and much harder to acquire.
