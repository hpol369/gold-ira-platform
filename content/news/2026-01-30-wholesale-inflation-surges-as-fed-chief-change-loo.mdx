The wholesale price surge at the end of 2024 just confirmed what I've been saying for years: **inflation is far from defeated**. While politicians and financial media celebrated "cooling" consumer prices, the real story was brewing in the wholesale markets.

Wholesale prices - what businesses pay for goods and services before they reach you - jumped sharply in the final months of last year. This matters because wholesale inflation is a leading indicator. What businesses pay today, you'll pay tomorrow. And with President Trump preparing to name a new Fed chairman, the battle over monetary policy is just heating up.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial establishment doesn't want you to understand: **the Fed has painted itself into a corner with no way out**.

For over a decade, they've pumped trillions of fake dollars into the system. They've kept interest rates artificially low, penalizing savers while rewarding borrowers and speculators. Now they're trying to fight the inflation monster they created, but every move they make hurts working Americans.

**Follow the money**, and you'll see the real game. When wholesale prices rise, it's not just random market forces. It's the direct result of all those printed dollars finally working their way through the economy. The dollar in your wallet today buys less than it did last year, and less than it will next year.

The incoming Fed chairman - whoever Trump picks - will inherit this mess. They can either keep printing money (disguised as "quantitative easing" or "emergency measures") and watch inflation explode, or they can raise rates and crash the economy. Either way, **your purchasing power gets destroyed**.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money sitting in traditional savings accounts, CDs, or money market funds, you're getting crushed. Let's do the math that your financial advisor won't show you.

Say you have $100,000 earning 4% in a "high-yield" savings account. Sounds good, right? Wrong. With wholesale inflation spiking and consumer prices following, your real return is negative. **You're losing purchasing power every single day**. That $100,000 might grow to $104,000 on paper, but it buys what $97,000 bought last year.

Your 401(k) and IRA aren't safe either. They're denominated in dollars - the same dollars the Fed keeps devaluing. Even if your account balance grows, you're still playing with fake money in a rigged game. The rich already know this, which is why they hold real assets, not paper promises.

## What You Should Do

**Stop being a victim of the Fed's money printing scheme**. This is why financial education matters more than ever.

First, understand that cash isn't king when the king is being debased. Look into real assets that have preserved wealth for thousands of years - assets the government can't print more of. Gold and silver have been real money long before central banks existed, and they'll be real money long after this monetary experiment fails.

Second, consider diversifying part of your retirement savings into a Gold IRA. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about protecting what you've already earned from the Fed's wealth transfer scheme.

The wholesale price surge is your wake-up call. Don't wait for permission from Wall Street or Washington to protect your retirement. **Take control now, while you still can**.
