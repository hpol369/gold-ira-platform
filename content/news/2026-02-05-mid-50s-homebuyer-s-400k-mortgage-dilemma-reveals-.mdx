A mid-50s American is facing a decision that perfectly illustrates the financial illiteracy crisis in this country. They want to buy a house and have $500,000 from selling their current home. But they're asking whether to take out a $400,000 mortgage or raid their Roth IRA to buy the house outright.

**The fact that they're even asking this question tells me everything I need to know about how poorly prepared Americans are for retirement.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what your financial advisor won't explain: **This isn't really about mortgages versus retirement accounts.** This is about understanding the difference between assets and liabilities, and how the Federal Reserve's money-printing machine is destroying your purchasing power.

The mainstream financial world will tell you to "never touch your retirement savings" and "mortgages are good debt." But I've been saying this for years - **that advice only works in a world where the dollar isn't being systematically devalued.**

We're living through the greatest wealth transfer in history. The Fed has printed trillions of dollars since 2008, and they're not stopping. Every dollar you have sitting in traditional retirement accounts is losing purchasing power daily. Meanwhile, real assets like real estate and precious metals are holding their value.

**The rich already know this.** They use cheap debt to buy appreciating assets. They don't leave massive piles of cash sitting in accounts earning 2% while inflation runs at 8%+ (the real inflation rate, not the government's manipulated numbers).

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're in your mid-50s with money in a Roth IRA, you need to wake up. **Your retirement timeline is getting shorter while your dollars are getting weaker.** That Roth IRA might look good on paper, but what will those dollars actually buy when you retire?

Let's do the math: If real inflation continues at 8% annually, that $400,000 in your Roth IRA loses $32,000 in purchasing power this year alone. In 10 years, it'll have the buying power of about $185,000 in today's money.

**Meanwhile, if you own real estate debt-free, you own a real asset.** No bank can take it. No government can print more of it. And you're not paying rent to someone else - you're building equity in something tangible.

This is why financial education matters. The system is designed to keep you confused about the difference between saving money and preserving wealth.

## What You Should Do

First, understand that being "debt-free" isn't automatically good if you're holding depreciating currency instead of appreciating assets. **Smart debt on appreciating assets can make you wealthy. Bad debt on depreciating liabilities makes you poor.**

If you're going to buy real estate, consider keeping some mortgage debt at today's rates and diversifying the rest of your wealth into real assets. Don't put all your eggs in one basket - even if that basket is real estate.

**Most importantly, get your retirement savings out of the dollar-denominated trap.** Consider rolling part of your IRA into physical gold and silver - real money that's held its value for 5,000 years. The wealthy have been moving into precious metals while regular Americans keep getting told to "stay the course" in traditional retirement accounts.

The choice isn't between a mortgage and your Roth IRA. **The real choice is between continuing to trust a system designed to keep you poor, or taking control of your financial future with real assets that can't be printed into oblivion.**

Learn how a Gold IRA can protect your retirement savings from currency debasement and give you the diversification the mainstream won't tell you about.
