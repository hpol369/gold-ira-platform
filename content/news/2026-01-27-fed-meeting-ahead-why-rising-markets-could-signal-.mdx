Stock futures are climbing this morning as investors position themselves ahead of another Federal Reserve meeting. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are showing green, while the Dow is lagging behind with GM earnings also in focus.

**Here's what's happening:** Markets are betting the Fed will continue its dovish stance, keeping interest rates suppressed and the money printer humming. Investors are celebrating because they think easy money policies mean higher stock prices forever.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

I've been saying this for years - **when markets rally because of Fed policy expectations, that's not a sign of economic strength. It's a sign of economic dependence.**

The mainstream financial media wants you to believe that rising stock futures are always good news. They won't tell you that these rallies are often built on one thing: the Fed's willingness to keep devaluing the dollar through money printing and artificially low interest rates.

**Follow the money.** When professional investors get excited about Fed meetings, it's because they're anticipating more cheap money flooding the system. That "cheap money" comes at the expense of your purchasing power.

The rich already know this game. They use Fed-inflated asset prices to their advantage while parking wealth in real assets like gold, silver, and real estate. Meanwhile, average Americans get excited about their 401(k) statements going up, not realizing they're getting paid in increasingly worthless dollars.

**Wake up, people.** The same system that creates these market rallies is the system that's been quietly destroying the value of your savings for decades.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money in traditional retirement accounts, these Fed-driven market rallies should concern you, not excite you. Here's why:

**Your "gains" might be fake gains.** Sure, your account balance might show bigger numbers, but what can those dollars actually buy? If the Fed keeps printing money to prop up markets, your retirement purchasing power gets hammered by inflation. You end up with more dollars that buy less stuff.

Think about it this way: If your 401(k) goes up 10% but inflation runs at 6%, you're only ahead by 4%. And that's if the government inflation numbers are honest - which many economists doubt. **This is why savers are losers in today's system.**

The Fed's policies create a wealth transfer from Main Street to Wall Street. Your savings get devalued while asset prices inflate, benefiting those who already own the most assets.

## What You Should Do

**Don't get caught up in short-term market euphoria.** Remember, the rich buy assets, the poor chase market rallies.

This is why financial education matters more than ever. You need to understand that traditional retirement planning advice - putting everything in stocks and bonds - leaves you completely exposed to Fed policy whims.

**Consider diversifying into real assets.** Gold and silver have been real money for thousands of years, long before central banks existed. They can't be printed into existence like dollars, and historically they've protected purchasing power when fiat currencies get debased.

Real estate, precious metals, and other tangible assets don't depend on Fed meetings for their long-term value. They derive value from scarcity and utility, not monetary manipulation.

If you're serious about protecting your retirement from dollar devaluation, consider learning about Gold IRAs and how precious metals can fit into your retirement strategy. Don't let Fed-driven market rallies distract you from the bigger picture: protecting your wealth with assets that can't be printed.

**The time to diversify is before you need to, not after.**
