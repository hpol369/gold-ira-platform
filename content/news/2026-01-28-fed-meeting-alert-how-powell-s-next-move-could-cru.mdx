All eyes are on Jerome Powell today as the Federal Reserve meets to decide the fate of interest rates. Wall Street analysts are buzzing about "two ways" Powell could move the S&P 500 - either by cutting rates to juice the markets or holding steady to fight inflation.

**Here's what you need to know:** The Fed has painted itself into a corner. Cut rates, and inflation roars back. Keep them high, and the everything bubble finally pops. Either way, your purchasing power takes the hit.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

I've been saying this for years - **the Fed doesn't work for you.** They work for the banks, the government, and Wall Street. Every decision they make transfers wealth from Main Street to the elites.

When they cut rates, they're essentially printing more money. Sure, your 401(k) might go up in nominal terms, but what good is that when a gallon of milk costs $8? **This is the biggest con game in history** - making you think you're getting richer while your dollars buy less and less.

And when they raise rates? Your bonds get crushed, your real estate values drop, but guess what stays the same? **Your need to eat, pay rent, and cover medical bills.** The rich already know this game. They've moved their wealth into real assets - gold, silver, real estate, businesses. Meanwhile, regular Americans are told to "stay the course" with their stock and bond portfolios.

Follow the money, people. The Fed has created over $5 trillion in new dollars since 2020. Where did that money go? Not to your savings account earning 0.5%. It went to prop up asset prices for those who already owned assets.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55+ with most of your retirement in traditional investments, **you're playing a rigged game.** Let's say you have $500,000 in your 401(k). If Powell cuts rates and inflation resurges to 8%, you're losing $40,000 per year in purchasing power. Your account balance might show $550,000, but you can buy what $460,000 used to purchase.

The mainstream financial advisors will tell you this is "temporary" or that you should "diversify across asset classes." But when both stocks AND bonds are priced in the same fake currency, you're not diversified - **you're concentrated in dollar risk.**

Here's the harsh truth: savers are losers in this system. The Fed has made it clear they will sacrifice the purchasing power of your retirement to keep the debt-based system running. Your financial education is your only defense.

## What You Should Do

**Stop thinking like your poor dad and start thinking like your rich dad.** Rich dad understood that real wealth isn't measured in dollars - it's measured in ounces, acres, and cashflow from real assets.

Consider diversifying a portion of your retirement into assets that have held value for thousands of years. Gold and silver aren't investments - they're insurance against monetary madness. When central banks around the world are buying gold at record levels, maybe it's time to pay attention.

The beauty of a Gold IRA is that you can move funds from your existing retirement accounts without tax penalties. You're not abandoning the system - **you're protecting yourself from it.**

Don't wait for permission from your financial advisor or for CNBC to tell you it's okay. The wealthy don't ask permission. They just act on knowledge while others are still getting educated by their losses.
