Mortgage and refinance rates are finally hitting what many rate watchers have been calling their "target range" as we move into February 2026. The mainstream media is celebrating this as great news for homebuyers and those looking to refinance.

**Here's what happened:** Rates have settled into what economists and industry experts have been predicting for months. Homebuyers are breathing a sigh of relief, and refinance applications are starting to tick upward.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

I've been saying this for years - **when mortgage rates hit their "target," it's not just about housing. It's about what the Fed is really doing to your purchasing power.**

Here's what the financial media won't explain: This "target range" didn't happen by accident. The Federal Reserve engineered this through years of monetary manipulation. And every time they adjust rates to hit these targets, they're making decisions that affect every dollar in your retirement account.

**The rich already know this secret:** When rates hit these so-called "sweet spots," it means the Fed has successfully transferred wealth from savers to borrowers. Think about it - who benefits most from lower rates? People taking on debt. Who gets hurt? People trying to live off their savings and fixed-income investments.

Follow the money, people. The same system that's celebrating these mortgage rates is the same system that's been quietly eroding the value of your 401(k) through currency debasement. **This is why financial education matters more than ever.**

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money in traditional retirement accounts, this mortgage rate news should be a wake-up call. Here's why:

**Your fixed-income investments are getting crushed.** CDs, bonds, and money market accounts - the "safe" investments your financial advisor probably recommended - are paying you interest that doesn't even keep up with real inflation. Meanwhile, the Fed's rate manipulation is designed to keep these returns artificially low.

Let's get specific: If you have $500,000 in a traditional IRA earning 3% in "safe" investments, you're making $15,000 per year. But with real inflation running much higher than the government admits, you're actually losing purchasing power every single year. **Savers are losers in this rigged game.**

## What You Should Do

Don't just celebrate lower mortgage rates and go back to sleep. This is the perfect time to **diversify your retirement savings into real assets that have protected wealth for thousands of years.**

The wealthy don't keep all their retirement money in paper assets that the Fed can manipulate with interest rate targets. They own gold, silver, and other tangible assets that maintain their purchasing power regardless of what games the central bankers play.

**Consider moving a portion of your IRA or 401(k) into physical precious metals.** A Gold IRA gives you the same tax advantages as your current retirement account, but with assets the Fed can't print more of. Learn how thousands of Americans are already protecting their retirement savings from currency debasement and Fed manipulation.

Don't let their "target ranges" become targets on your retirement security.
