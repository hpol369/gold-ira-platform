Oil prices took a nosedive on Monday after President Trump expressed optimism about negotiations with Iran. **The black gold that many thought was heading to the moon suddenly crashed back to earth.**

This kind of volatility isn't new. But it's a perfect reminder of something I've been teaching for decades: **paper assets can turn against you in a heartbeat.** And if you're counting on them for retirement, you're playing a very dangerous game.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial "experts" won't mention about oil's latest roller coaster ride: **this volatility is a feature of our fake money system, not a bug.**

When everything is priced in dollars that the Fed can print at will, prices become disconnected from real value. Oil doesn't just go up and down based on supply and demand anymore. It swings wildly based on political tweets, Fed policy hints, and Wall Street speculation.

**The mainstream media will tell you this is just "market dynamics."** I call it what it is: a rigged casino where the house always wins. And guess who the house is? It's not you and me.

Think about it. Oil is still the same black liquid that powers our economy. The supply didn't magically increase overnight. The demand didn't disappear. But the price moved dramatically because of... what? Hope about negotiations?

**This is what happens when real assets get traded like paper in a fake money system.** The rich understand this. That's why they own the real stuff - the actual wells, the refineries, the physical commodities. They let the middle class play with the paper representations while they control the real assets.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're sitting there thinking "I don't own oil stocks, so this doesn't affect me," wake up. **Your 401(k) and IRA are filled with paper assets that can swing just as wildly.**

Your energy sector funds just took a hit. Your international funds that depend on oil-exporting countries got hammered. Even your "safe" bond funds are affected because interest rates and commodity prices are all connected in this rigged system.

But here's the bigger picture: **this oil volatility is showing you exactly what will happen to your retirement savings when the next real crisis hits.** Not if - when. The same forces that can crash oil prices in a day can wipe out years of your retirement savings in hours.

The mainstream financial advisors will tell you to "stay the course" and "ride out the volatility." That's easy for them to say - they're getting paid whether you retire comfortably or eat cat food.

## What You Should Do

First, understand that **volatility in paper assets is going to get worse, not better.** The Fed's money printing has created bubbles everywhere, and bubbles eventually pop.

Second, start thinking like the wealthy do. **They don't put all their eggs in the Wall Street basket.** They diversify into real assets that have held value for thousands of years.

This is why I've been advocating for precious metals in retirement accounts for decades. Gold doesn't tweet. Silver doesn't get into political negotiations. **They just sit there, holding their value while paper assets swing wildly.**

Consider exploring a self-directed IRA that gives you control over your retirement destiny. You can still keep some traditional investments, but **smart money diversifies into assets that can't be printed, tweeted, or manipulated into oblivion.**

The rich already know this secret. The question is: when will you stop playing their rigged game and start protecting your retirement the same way they protect their wealth?

Your future self will thank you for making the move to real assets before the next crisis hits.
