The Federal Reserve just issued another enforcement action against a former Regions Bank employee. While the details are still emerging, this is yet another example of problems within our banking and monetary system that most Americans never hear about.

These enforcement actions happen more often than you think. But they rarely make headlines because the mainstream financial media doesn't want you asking uncomfortable questions about the institutions managing your money.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

**Here's what the financial establishment doesn't want you to understand:** These enforcement actions are symptoms of a much bigger problem with our entire monetary system.

The Fed has created a system where banks are incentivized to take massive risks with other people's money. When interest rates are artificially suppressed for years - like they were from 2008 to 2022 - banks have to reach for yield in increasingly dangerous ways. That means more risk, more bad behavior, and more "enforcement actions."

**I've been saying this for years:** The Federal Reserve isn't your friend. They've created a system that systematically transfers wealth from savers to speculators. While you're getting 0.5% on your savings account, the big banks are borrowing money from the Fed at near-zero rates and investing it in riskier assets.

Follow the money, people. Every time there's a banking scandal or enforcement action, ask yourself: Where were the regulators? The same Fed that's supposed to protect you is the same institution that created the incentives for this behavior in the first place.

**This is why financial education matters.** The rich already know that the banking system isn't designed to make them wealthy - it's designed to make the banks wealthy. That's why they don't keep their wealth in savings accounts or trust their entire financial future to institutions that regularly face enforcement actions.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you have your retirement savings sitting in traditional bank products or low-yield savings accounts, you're essentially lending money to the same institutions that keep facing these enforcement actions. You're taking on their risk while getting paid almost nothing for it.

**Wake up:** Your 401(k) and IRA are likely invested in the same financial system that produces these scandals. When banks face enforcement actions, it signals systemic problems that could eventually impact your retirement accounts. Remember 2008? Those "isolated incidents" became a full-blown crisis that wiped out trillions in retirement savings.

Even worse, while you're worrying about bank enforcement actions, the Fed continues printing money and devaluing every dollar in your retirement account. **Savers are losers** in this system, and recent retirees are finding out the hard way that their "safe" retirement accounts don't buy what they used to.

## What You Should Do

**Don't put all your eggs in the banking system's basket.** The rich diversify into real assets that exist outside the traditional banking system. That's why they buy gold, silver, and real estate - assets that don't depend on bank stability or Fed policies.

Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into assets that banks can't manipulate or that the Fed can't print. A Gold IRA allows you to hold physical precious metals in your retirement account, giving you a hedge against both banking system problems and currency devaluation.

The mainstream financial advisors won't tell you this because they make money keeping you in the traditional system. But you don't have to keep all your retirement wealth in institutions that regularly face enforcement actions. **Learn about how precious metals can protect your retirement savings** and give you the peace of mind that comes from owning real assets in an increasingly unstable financial system.
