The dollar is making headlines again, and not for good reasons. Despite promises to make America's currency "great again," the greenback continues its long-term decline against real assets like gold, real estate, and other currencies.

**Here's the reality:** The dollar has lost over 96% of its purchasing power since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913. And the pace is accelerating. While politicians talk tough about currency strength, they keep printing more money to fund government spending and bailouts.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

**The weak dollar isn't a bug in the system - it's a feature.**

I've been saying this for years: the financial elite benefit from currency debasement while average Americans get crushed. When the dollar weakens, it makes U.S. exports cheaper and reduces the real burden of government debt. Wall Street loves it because it inflates asset prices.

But here's what they don't mention on CNBC: **a weak dollar is a tax on savers and retirees.**

Every time the Fed fires up the money printer, your cash savings lose value. That $100,000 in your savings account? It buys less groceries, less gas, less healthcare than it did five years ago. This is why financial education matters - you need to understand that cash is not a safe investment anymore.

**Follow the money, and you'll see the truth.** The rich already know this secret. They don't hold cash - they hold assets that appreciate when currencies weaken. Gold, silver, real estate, businesses. These are the assets that maintain purchasing power when politicians devalue the money supply.

The mainstream media won't connect these dots because their advertisers - the big banks and financial institutions - profit from keeping you in dollar-denominated investments they can charge fees on.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

**If your retirement savings are sitting in cash or cash-equivalent investments, you're getting poorer every day.**

Let's do the math. If inflation is running at 3-4% annually (and many economists argue the real rate is higher), your $500,000 retirement nest egg loses $15,000-$20,000 in purchasing power each year just sitting there.

Your 401(k) might show growth on paper, but ask yourself this: **Can that account balance buy you the same lifestyle it could five years ago?** Probably not. While your account statement might look good, the underlying purchasing power is eroding.

This is especially dangerous for Americans 55+ who don't have decades to recover from currency devaluation. You need your money to maintain its value, not slowly bleed purchasing power while politicians promise to fix problems they created.

## What You Should Do

**Stop being a victim of monetary policy and start thinking like the wealthy.**

First, get educated about real money versus fake money. Gold and silver have been stores of value for thousands of years. They can't be printed into existence by politicians or central bankers.

Second, consider diversifying your retirement savings beyond traditional dollar-based investments. **This doesn't mean going all-in on precious metals, but it does mean not putting all your eggs in the dollar basket.**

Many Americans are discovering they can move funds from their existing 401(k) or IRA into precious metals without tax penalties through a Gold IRA rollover. This allows you to own physical gold and silver inside your retirement account while maintaining the tax advantages.

The rich understand that true wealth preservation requires owning assets that hold their value regardless of what politicians do to the currency. **It's time you learned the same lesson.**

If you're serious about protecting your retirement from dollar devaluation, consider learning more about how precious metals can fit into your retirement strategy. Your future purchasing power depends on the decisions you make today.
