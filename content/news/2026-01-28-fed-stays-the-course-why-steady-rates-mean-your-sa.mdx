The Federal Reserve just announced they're keeping interest rates steady, despite mounting pressure from President Trump to cut them. **The Fed funds rate stays in the 5.25-5.50% range**, marking their commitment to "data-dependent" policy making.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: they're not bowing to political pressure. The central bank wants to see more evidence that inflation is truly under control before making their next move.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media won't explain: **The Fed isn't your friend, and steady rates don't mean steady wealth.**

I've been saying this for years—the Federal Reserve exists to protect the banking system, not your retirement account. When they talk about "stability," they mean stability for Wall Street, not Main Street.

**Follow the money.** While they keep rates steady at around 5%, real inflation—the stuff you actually buy like food, energy, and housing—is eating away at your purchasing power faster than your savings can grow. The government's official inflation numbers are a joke. Anyone who shops for groceries knows the real story.

The rich already know this game. They don't keep their wealth in dollars earning 5% while real inflation runs 8-10%. **They buy real assets: gold, silver, real estate, businesses.** Assets that can't be printed into existence by bureaucrats in Washington.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

Let's get real about your 401(k). If you've got $500,000 in retirement savings earning 5% in "safe" investments, you're making $25,000 a year. Sounds good, right?

Wrong. **Savers are losers when the dollar keeps getting devalued.** That $25,000 buys less every single month. Your retirement account might show bigger numbers, but your purchasing power is shrinking. It's the cruelest tax of all—inflation—and it hits retirees the hardest.

This is why financial education matters. The mainstream financial advisors tell you to "stay the course" and "dollar-cost average" while your wealth slowly evaporates. Meanwhile, the Fed keeps the printing presses running to bail out banks and fund government spending.

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. **Diversify out of the dollar before it's too late.** I'm not saying dump everything, but get some of your retirement wealth into real assets that have protected purchasing power for thousands of years.

Gold and silver aren't investments—they're insurance against exactly what's happening right now. When the Fed finally has to choose between letting the system collapse or printing even more money, guess what they'll choose?

**The time to act is while rates are "steady," not when the next crisis hits.** Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into a Gold IRA. It's one of the few ways to own real money inside your retirement account while the Fed continues their money-printing experiment.

Don't let the Fed's "stability" fool you. Your retirement is too important to trust to politicians and bureaucrats who've never had to worry about making ends meet in the real world.
