The Federal Reserve Board just announced approval for Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito Elga, Ltda. to operate in the U.S. financial system. While this might sound like routine banking news, it's actually another piece of the puzzle showing how the Fed continues expanding the financial system while your dollar loses value.

**Here's what happened:** The Fed gave the green light to this credit union to participate in our banking system. It's part of the ongoing expansion of financial institutions operating under Fed oversight.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

The mainstream financial media will frame this as normal regulatory business. Just another approval, nothing to see here. **But I've been saying this for years - every expansion of the Fed-controlled banking system is another step toward centralizing financial control.**

Here's what the mainstream won't tell you: **The Fed isn't just approving banks - it's building a network of institutions all dancing to the same tune.** More Fed-approved institutions means more entities participating in the same system that's been printing dollars into oblivion since 2008.

**Follow the money.** While they approve new players in the banking game, they're simultaneously running policies that make your cash worth less every day. The rich already know this - that's why they don't keep their wealth in dollars. They convert it to real assets before the purchasing power disappears.

This is why financial education matters. **The system is designed to keep you focused on getting approved for loans and opening new accounts, while your existing dollars lose value.** Every new institution in the Fed system becomes another channel for the same inflationary policies that are crushing savers.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money sitting in traditional savings or CDs, **you're watching your retirement purchasing power evaporate in real time.** The Fed keeps expanding the banking system while maintaining near-zero interest rates that guarantee your cash loses value to inflation.

Let's get specific. Say you have $200,000 in retirement savings earning 1% in a CD. With real inflation running much higher than official numbers, **you're actually losing 3-5% of purchasing power annually.** That means your $200,000 only buys what $190,000 bought last year.

**Wake up, people.** The Fed isn't working for your retirement security. Every new bank they approve becomes another participant in the wealth transfer from savers to borrowers, from Main Street to Wall Street.

## What You Should Do

Stop playing their game with your retirement money. **The rich don't keep their wealth in the same system that's designed to devalue it.** They diversify into real assets - gold, silver, real estate - things that hold value when currencies get debased.

**Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into precious metals through a Gold IRA.** While the Fed approves more banks to participate in their dollar-devaluation scheme, gold maintains its purchasing power over time. It's real money, not the fake fiat currency they keep printing.

Don't trust the government with your entire retirement future. **Diversify into assets that have protected wealth for thousands of years, not just since the Fed was created in 1913.**

The time to act is while you still can convert dollars into real assets at today's prices. Tomorrow, those same dollars will buy less of everything - including gold.
