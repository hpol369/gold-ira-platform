A Federal Reserve governor just said the quiet part out loud. Chris Waller, one of Trump's finalists for Fed chief, announced Friday that the central bank should have cut interest rates this week because of what he called "zero, zip, nada" new jobs in the market.

**This isn't just about employment numbers.** This is about the Fed's next move to devalue your savings - and they're not even hiding it anymore.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media won't explain: When Fed officials start talking about rate cuts because of "poor job markets," they're really announcing the next round of currency debasement.

**I've been saying this for years** - the Fed only has one playbook when things get tough: print more money and make it cheaper to borrow. They call it "stimulus." I call it theft from savers.

Follow the money here. **The rich already know this.** When rates get cut, asset prices inflate. Real estate goes up. Stocks go up. Gold goes up. But your cash savings? They lose purchasing power faster than you can say "zero jobs."

The mainstream wants you to believe rate cuts are good for the economy. What they won't tell you is that **rate cuts are wealth transfers** - from people who save money to people who own assets. Guess which group most retirees fall into?

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're sitting on cash in traditional savings accounts or CDs, you're about to get crushed. **Lower rates mean lower returns on your safe investments** - but your cost of living keeps climbing.

Let's do the math. If rates drop and your CD goes from 4% to 2%, but inflation stays at 3%, you're losing 1% of your purchasing power every year. On a $100,000 retirement account, **that's $1,000 in real wealth disappearing annually.**

Here's the bigger problem: When the Fed cuts rates, they typically don't stop at one cut. They cut repeatedly until something breaks or inflation explodes. **Your 401(k) and IRA sitting in cash equivalents become wealth destruction machines.**

This is why financial education matters. The system is designed to make your money worth less while telling you it's "for your own good."

## What You Should Do

**Wake up, people.** The writing is on the wall. Fed governors don't accidentally announce rate-cutting intentions unless they're already planning the policy.

The rich don't keep their wealth in depreciating dollars. They move into real assets - things that hold value when currencies get debased. **Gold has been real money for 5,000 years.** The dollar has been "money" for 53 years, and it's lost over 95% of its purchasing power in that time.

Don't trust the government with your retirement security. **The same institution that created this mess isn't going to save you from it.** Consider diversifying a portion of your retirement savings into precious metals through a Gold IRA.

The mainstream won't tell you this, but you can move funds from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s into gold and silver without tax penalties. **It's called a rollover, and it might be the smartest financial move you make** as the Fed prepares its next assault on savers.

Your financial future is too important to leave in the hands of people who think "zero jobs" is a reason to make your money worth less.
