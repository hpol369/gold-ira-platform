The Federal Reserve just gave its stamp of approval to Cornerstone Capital Bancorp's latest application. Another day, another bank consolidation getting the green light from our central bank overlords.

While the Fed didn't release specifics about the deal size or structure, this approval follows a familiar pattern. **The banking system continues to consolidate while regular Americans watch their purchasing power evaporate.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media won't explain: Every time the Fed approves these bank mergers, they're essentially creating bigger institutions that are "too big to fail."

**This isn't about improving banking services for you and me.** It's about concentrating financial power into fewer hands. The same hands that benefit every time the Fed prints more money to bail out the system.

I've been saying this for years - the game is rigged. When banks get bigger, they get more political influence. More influence means more bailouts when things go wrong. **And guess who pays for those bailouts? Your tax dollars and the devaluation of every dollar in your retirement account.**

The Fed loves to talk about "financial stability" when they approve these deals. But here's the truth: **They're creating the exact opposite.** Bigger banks take bigger risks because they know Uncle Sam will rescue them. Meanwhile, community banks that actually serve local communities get squeezed out.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money in traditional retirement accounts, this banking consolidation should concern you. **Fewer banks means less competition, which means worse deals for savers like you.**

Think about it: When was the last time your bank offered you a meaningful interest rate on your savings? With inflation running hot and banks getting bigger and lazier, **your cash is losing purchasing power every single day.**

Here's the math that'll make you sick. If you have $100,000 in a savings account earning 0.5% while real inflation runs at 6%, **you're losing about $5,500 in purchasing power every year.** The banking giants approved by the Fed don't care - they're making money on the spread while you get poorer.

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. **The banking system isn't designed to make you wealthy - it's designed to transfer your wealth to the financial elite.**

This is why financial education matters more than ever. The rich already know this secret: **Real money is gold and silver, not digits in a bank computer.** While banks consolidate and currencies get debased, precious metals maintain their purchasing power over decades.

Stop playing the rigged game. **Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into real assets that can't be printed, manipulated, or bailed out.** Gold and silver have been real money for thousands of years - long before the Federal Reserve existed, and they'll be real money long after it's gone.

The wealthy don't keep all their eggs in the banking basket. Neither should you. Learn how a Gold IRA can protect your retirement savings from the Fed's money printing machine and give you the financial education they don't want you to have.
