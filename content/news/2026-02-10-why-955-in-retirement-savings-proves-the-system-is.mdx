Wake up, people. The latest data just dropped, and it's worse than most realize.

**The median amount American workers have saved for retirement is $955.** Not $95,500. Not even $9,550. Nine hundred and fifty-five dollars.

That's less than most people spend on a vacation. It's what some folks drop on a nice dinner for two. And it's supposed to fund your golden years.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial media won't say: **This isn't happening by accident.**

The system is working exactly as designed—to keep you dependent and broke. While you're being told to "save more" and "cut back on lattes," the Fed has been printing money like there's no tomorrow, making every dollar in your savings account worth less each year.

I've been saying this for years: **Savers are losers.** And this $955 figure proves it perfectly.

Think about it. We've had over a decade of near-zero interest rates. Your "high-yield" savings account pays what—0.5%? Meanwhile, real inflation (not the government's fake numbers) has been eating your purchasing power alive.

**The rich already know this.** They don't keep their wealth in savings accounts or even traditional retirement plans. They buy real assets—gold, silver, real estate, businesses. Things that hold value when currencies collapse.

Follow the money, and you'll see the wealthy have been moving into hard assets while telling everyone else to "stay the course" with their 401(k)s.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're sitting there thinking, "Well, at least I have more than $955," don't get comfortable.

**Even if you have $100,000 or $500,000 saved, you're still playing a rigged game.** That money is sitting in a system designed to transfer your wealth to Wall Street through fees, market manipulation, and currency debasement.

Let's do some real math. Say you're 60 with $200,000 in your 401(k). Sounds decent, right? But if inflation runs at just 6% annually (and it's been higher), your purchasing power gets cut in half every 12 years.

**Your $200,000 today buys what $100,000 bought 12 years ago.** And what will it buy when you actually need it at 75? Maybe $50,000 worth of real goods and services.

This is why financial education matters more than ever. The game has changed, but nobody told Main Street the rules.

## What You Should Do

First, **stop playing their game by their rules.** Maxing out your 401(k) into the same old stock and bond funds isn't financial planning—it's financial suicide.

Start diversifying into real assets. Real money. Gold and silver have been stores of value for 5,000 years. They can't be printed, manipulated, or inflated away by some bureaucrat at the Federal Reserve.

**Consider a self-directed IRA or a Gold IRA.** These give you control over your retirement destiny instead of leaving it in the hands of Wall Street fund managers who get rich whether you win or lose.

The $955 median isn't just a statistic—it's a wake-up call. Don't let your retirement become another casualty of a system designed to keep you poor while making the rich richer.

The time to act is now, while you still can.
