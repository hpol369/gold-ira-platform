Here we go again. The government announces Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) like it's some kind of gift to retirees. But **here's what they don't tell you upfront**: Medicare premiums are about to eat up more than 25% of that increase.

Let's break this down in plain English. Say you're getting that COLA boost to help with rising costs. Sounds good, right? Wrong. **Before you even see that money, Medicare is taking its bigger cut.** What you thought was relief from inflation just became another wealth transfer - from your pocket to the government's healthcare bureaucracy.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

The mainstream financial media will spin this as "necessary healthcare adjustments" or "the cost of an aging population." **Here's what they won't tell you**: This is exactly how the system is designed to keep you dependent and broke.

Think about it. The same government that's been printing money like crazy - driving up the cost of everything from groceries to gas - is now telling you they need to raise Medicare premiums to "keep up with costs." **They create the inflation, then make you pay for it twice.**

I've been saying this for years: **the government is not your financial friend.** Every "benefit" comes with hidden costs. Every "adjustment" somehow leaves you with less purchasing power than before. This Medicare premium grab is just another example of how the system transfers wealth from Main Street to the bureaucratic machine.

**Follow the money.** Where do you think those higher Medicare premiums go? Into the same broken healthcare system that charges $50 for an aspirin and $500 for a bag of saline. The rich already know this game - they don't count on Social Security or Medicare. They build their own wealth outside the system.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're sitting there thinking "Well, at least I have Social Security," **wake up.** You're watching your government benefits get diluted in real time. Today it's 25% of your COLA going to Medicare premiums. Tomorrow it could be 50%.

**Here's the brutal math**: Let's say your Social Security goes up $100 per month. Medicare premiums take $25 of that. But thanks to real inflation (not the government's fake numbers), your actual purchasing power probably went down. You're getting poorer while they tell you you're getting a raise.

This is exactly why I say **savers are losers** and why depending on government promises is financial suicide. Every retiree watching their "guaranteed" benefits shrink is learning this lesson the hard way.

## What You Should Do

**Stop playing defense with your retirement.** The government just showed you - again - that they'll find ways to claw back any benefits they give you. You need to take control of your own financial future.

**Diversify out of their system.** While they're playing shell games with Social Security and Medicare, the wealthy are protecting their purchasing power with real assets. Gold, silver, real estate - assets that hold their value when governments debase their currencies.

Consider moving some of your retirement savings into a self-directed IRA that gives you control over real assets like precious metals. **The rich already know this secret** - they don't keep all their wealth in paper promises that politicians can manipulate.

**This is why financial education matters.** Every day you wait is another day your retirement savings lose purchasing power to their money-printing schemes. Don't let Medicare premium increases be the wake-up call you should have had years ago.
