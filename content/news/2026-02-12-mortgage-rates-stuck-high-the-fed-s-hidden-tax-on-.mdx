Mortgage and refinance rates barely budged this week, with most lenders keeping rates in the high 6% to 7% range. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate remains stuck near levels we haven't seen since 2008, while the Fed continues its monetary juggling act.

**Here's the reality:** While everyone's focused on whether rates will drop a quarter-point here or there, they're missing the bigger picture. These "high" rates are actually low when you factor in real inflation.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

The financial media wants you to believe this is just a normal economic cycle. **That's complete nonsense.**

What's really happening is the Fed is trapped in their own money-printing scheme. They've created so much fake money over the past decade that they can't lower rates without triggering runaway inflation. But they also can't raise them too much without crashing the overleveraged economy they helped create.

**Follow the money.** Who benefits from keeping rates at these levels? The banks, who can borrow cheap from the Fed and lend expensive to you. Meanwhile, your savings account still pays you basically nothing while inflation quietly steals your purchasing power every single day.

I've been saying this for years: **savers are losers in this rigged system.** The Fed has engineered a wealth transfer from Main Street to Wall Street, and these mortgage rates are just another tool in their toolkit.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older, these persistent high rates should be a massive wake-up call about what's coming for your retirement savings.

**Think about it:** If you can't afford to buy or refinance a home at these rates, what do you think is happening to the purchasing power of your 401(k)? While your retirement account shows the same number of dollars, those dollars buy less house, less food, less everything. That's the hidden tax of currency debasement, and it's eating your retirement alive.

Here's the math the financial advisors won't show you: Even if your portfolio grows 6% annually, but real inflation runs 8-10%, **you're going backwards every year.** Your nest egg might look bigger on paper, but it's shrinking in real purchasing power.

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. **The rich already know this.** They're not keeping their wealth in paper assets that can be devalued by Fed policy. They own real assets: real estate, businesses, commodities, and precious metals.

This is why financial education matters more than ever. You need to understand that your retirement isn't just about accumulating dollars – it's about preserving purchasing power over decades.

**Consider this:** While mortgage rates stay elevated and your savings get decimated by inflation, gold and silver have maintained their purchasing power for thousands of years. They can't be printed, manipulated, or devalued by central bank policy.

The smart money is already diversifying into real assets. If you're concerned about protecting your retirement savings from this monetary madness, it might be time to learn how a Gold IRA can shield your nest egg from the Fed's currency destruction game.

Don't let their system make you poor. **Take control of your financial education and your retirement destiny.**
