FedEx stock rocketed 15% higher this week after the shipping giant announced better-than-expected earnings and raised guidance for the fiscal year. Wall Street celebrated as FedEx reported quarterly revenue of $21.7 billion and said it's seeing strong demand across its express and ground networks.

The mainstream media is calling it a "logistics recovery story" and pointing to increased e-commerce shipping volumes. But here's what they're missing: **This rally isn't about FedEx getting stronger - it's about your dollar getting weaker.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

I've been saying this for years: **when everything costs more, it's not because things are getting more valuable - it's because your money is becoming worthless.**

FedEx can raise prices because the Fed has flooded the system with cheap money. When Jerome Powell prints trillions of dollars, that new money has to go somewhere. Some goes into stocks (hello, FedEx rally), some goes into real estate, and some goes into the cost of shipping your Amazon packages.

**Follow the money.** The Fed's money printing machine doesn't just inflate stock prices - it inflates the cost of everything. FedEx's "strong pricing power" is really just inflation in disguise. They're charging more because they can, because everyone's paying with devalued dollars.

Here's the kicker: while FedEx shareholders celebrate their 15% gain, the real purchasing power of that gain is being eaten alive by the very inflation that created it. **It's a hamster wheel designed to keep you running but never getting ahead.**

The rich already know this. They're not celebrating paper gains - they're converting those gains into real assets that hold value when the music stops.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you've got a traditional 401(k) or IRA sitting in stocks and bonds, you're playing a rigged game. Sure, your account balance might go up when stocks like FedEx rally, but **what can that money actually buy when you need it?**

Let's get specific: Say you had $100,000 in retirement savings three years ago. Even if that's grown to $115,000 today (a decent return), your groceries cost 25% more, your gas costs 40% more, and your healthcare premiums have skyrocketed. **You're mathematically poorer despite your account balance being higher.**

This is exactly what happened to retirees in the 1970s. Their stock portfolios showed gains on paper while their standard of living got crushed by inflation. The Fed's playbook hasn't changed - they're just running the same game with bigger numbers.

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. **Stop measuring your wealth in dollars and start measuring it in purchasing power.** The wealthy don't keep all their money in paper assets that can be inflated away overnight.

Diversify into real assets that have maintained purchasing power for thousands of years. Gold and silver aren't investments - they're insurance against exactly what's happening right now. When the dollar loses value, precious metals typically maintain theirs.

Consider moving a portion of your retirement savings into a Gold IRA. While FedEx might rally another 15% or crash 30%, gold has been real money for 5,000 years. **It's not about getting rich quick - it's about staying rich long-term.**

The financial education you need isn't coming from Wall Street or your 401(k) provider. They profit when you stay in the system. Learn how to protect your retirement savings with assets the Fed can't print into oblivion.
