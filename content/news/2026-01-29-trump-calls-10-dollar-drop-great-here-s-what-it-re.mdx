The U.S. dollar just suffered its worst annual performance in years, dropping 10% over the past 12 months. While most Americans are scratching their heads wondering what this means, **President Trump is calling it "great" for American competitiveness**.

Here's what actually happened: Our currency lost significant value against other major currencies, making everything we import more expensive while supposedly making our exports cheaper. The mainstream media is spinning this as either neutral or potentially positive for trade. **But they're missing the real story.**

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the financial establishment doesn't want you to understand: **when the dollar drops 10%, your purchasing power just got hammered**.

I've been saying this for years - the Federal Reserve and our government have been systematically destroying the value of your dollars through money printing and fiscal irresponsibility. This 10% drop isn't some natural market fluctuation. **It's the direct result of decades of monetary policy that favors Wall Street over Main Street.**

Follow the money, and you'll see exactly what's happening. The Fed prints trillions of new dollars, flooding the system with fake money. Meanwhile, countries like China and Russia are moving away from dollar-based transactions. **The rich already know this game - they've been moving their wealth into real assets like gold, silver, and real estate for years.**

Trump might call a weaker dollar "great" because it helps certain industries and makes our debt easier to pay off with cheaper money. But here's the truth: **every time the dollar weakens, you're getting poorer, and the government's debts become easier to inflate away**.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you're 55 or older with money sitting in traditional savings accounts, CDs, or even conservative bond funds, **you just lost 10% of your purchasing power in real terms**. That $100,000 you thought was "safe" in the bank? It now buys what $90,000 bought a year ago.

But it gets worse. Your 401(k) might show positive numbers on paper, but if the dollar keeps declining, those gains are largely an illusion. **You're making money in a currency that's worth less every year**. It's like being the richest person in a country with worthless money.

This is why I keep saying savers are losers in this environment. The financial system is designed to transfer wealth from people who save in dollars to those who own real assets. **While you're being told to be a good saver, the value of what you're saving is being systematically destroyed.**

## What You Should Do

Wake up, people. **The time for traditional "safe" retirement planning is over**. You need to start thinking like the wealthy think - in terms of real assets, not paper promises.

First, educate yourself about what real money actually is. Gold and silver have been stores of value for thousands of years, while every fiat currency in history has eventually gone to zero. Second, **consider diversifying at least a portion of your retirement savings into precious metals through a Gold IRA**. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about protecting what you've already worked so hard to build.

The rich don't keep all their wealth in dollars for a reason. **Maybe it's time you stopped playing by rules that were designed to keep you poor**. Your retirement depends on it.
