## What Happened

The Federal Reserve announced today that they're holding interest rates steady at 4.5%. The mainstream financial media is calling this "good news for the economy" and celebrating the "stability" this brings.

Fed Chair Powell stated that the economy remains "resilient" and that they're monitoring inflation closely before making any changes. The markets rallied on the news, with the S&P 500 up 0.5% in early trading.

## What the Mainstream Won't Tell You

Here's what the talking heads on CNBC won't explain to you:

**The Fed is trapped.** They can't raise rates without crashing the economy and the stock market. They can't lower rates without admitting the economy is weaker than they claim - and reigniting inflation.

So they sit. And wait. And hope.

But hope is not a strategy for your retirement.

**The real story is what's happening to your purchasing power.** While the Fed claims inflation is "moderating," go to the grocery store. Fill up your gas tank. Pay your insurance premium. Real inflation - the kind that affects your daily life - is still running hot.

I've been saying this for years: **the dollar is being destroyed**. Not quickly, not dramatically, but steadily and consistently. Every year your savings buy less. Every year your retirement nest egg shrinks in real terms.

The wealthy understand this. That's why central banks around the world are buying gold at record levels. That's why billionaires are quietly moving into hard assets. They know what's coming.

## What This Means for Your Retirement

If you have a 401(k) or IRA sitting in cash, bonds, or money market funds earning 4-5%, ask yourself: **is that really keeping up with real inflation?**

Here's the math the financial advisors won't show you:

- Your "high-yield" savings: 4.5%
- Real inflation (food, energy, housing): 7-9%
- **You're losing 3-4% per year in purchasing power**

That means a $500,000 retirement account is losing $15,000-$20,000 in real value every single year. In ten years, you've lost $150,000-$200,000 in purchasing power - even though your account balance looks the same.

This is the silent retirement killer that nobody talks about.

## What You Should Do

The wealthy don't save dollars - they save assets. Gold, silver, real estate. Things that can't be printed out of thin air by politicians and central bankers.

**Consider diversifying a portion of your retirement into physical gold.** Not paper gold, not ETFs - actual physical gold held in a tax-advantaged Gold IRA.

Gold has preserved purchasing power for 5,000 years. The dollar has lost 98% of its value since the Fed was created in 1913.

Which one do you trust with your retirement?
