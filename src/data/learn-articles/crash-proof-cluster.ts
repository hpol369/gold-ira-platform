        question: 'How much of my portfolio should be in depression-proof assets?',
        answer: 'For retirement portfolios, consider 60-70% in depression-resistant assets: 25% gold, 30% treasuries, 5% cash, and 40% in defensive stocks. This provides both protection and growth. Adjust based on your risk tolerance and timeline.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is cash depression-proof?',
        answer: 'It depends on deflation vs inflation. In Great Depression (deflation), cash gained purchasing power. In 1970s stagflation, cash lost to inflation. Cash is safe short-term but risky long-term. Gold protects against both scenarios.'
