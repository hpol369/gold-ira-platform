        answer: 'The Medicaid lookback period is a 60-month (5-year) review of all asset transfers made before applying for Medicaid. Transfers made for less than fair market value during this period can result in a penalty period where Medicaid won\'t cover nursing home costs.',

      {
        question: 'How is the Medicaid penalty period calculated?',
        answer: 'The penalty period is calculated by dividing the total value of improper transfers by the average monthly nursing home cost in your state. For example, a $100,000 transfer in a state with $10,000/month average cost results in a 10-month penalty.',

      {
        question: 'What transfers are exempt from Medicaid lookback?',
        answer: 'Exempt transfers include: transfers to a spouse, transfers to a blind or disabled child, transfers to a caregiver child who lived with you for 2+ years, transfers of home to siblings with equity interest, and sales at fair market value. These do not trigger penalties.',

        question: 'Can I gift money to family and still qualify for Medicaid?',
        answer: 'Gifts within 5 years of applying for Medicaid can trigger penalty periods. However, if you don\'t anticipate needing nursing home care for at least 5 years, gifts made now will be outside the lookback period when you apply. Small gifts may be acceptable in some states.',
