        question: 'Can power of attorney prevent guardianship?',
        answer: 'Yes. If you have a properly executed durable power of attorney in place before becoming incapacitated, guardianship is usually unnecessary. The POA agent can already manage your affairs without court involvement. However, if the POA is being abused or is insufficient, a court may still impose guardianship.',

      {
        question: 'Which is stronger - POA or guardianship?',
        answer: 'Guardianship is generally "stronger" in that it has court backing and oversight. A guardian\'s authority is court-ordered and harder to challenge. However, POA is more flexible and preserves more autonomy. Banks and institutions may be more willing to accept guardianship orders than POA documents.',

      {
        question: 'Can you have both POA and guardianship?',
        answer: 'Typically, no. If a guardianship is established, it usually supersedes and terminates any existing power of attorney. The court-appointed guardian takes over decision-making authority. However, in some cases, a guardian may choose to ratify actions taken by a previous POA agent.',

        question: 'What if my 401k plan doesn\'t allow per stirpes?',
        answer: 'Some employer plans have limited beneficiary options. You have three choices: (1) Ask your HR/plan administrator if per stirpes can be added, (2) Roll the 401k to an IRA (if you\'re eligible) where you have full control, or (3) Use a trust as the beneficiary with per stirpes distribution instructions.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Does per stirpes affect required minimum distributions (RMDs)?',
        answer: 'Per stirpes only affects who inherits - not RMD calculations during your lifetime. After death, inherited IRA RMDs are based on each beneficiary\'s age. Grandchildren who inherit via per stirpes may have different RMD requirements than your children.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I change per stirpes designation after I set it up?',
        answer: 'Yes, you can change beneficiary designations (including adding or removing per stirpes) at any time while you\'re alive and mentally competent. Simply submit a new beneficiary form to your IRA custodian or 401k plan administrator.',

        answer: 'Technically yes, but not recommended. Guardianship is complex legal process with strict procedural requirements.

        question: 'What if my siblings disagree about guardianship?',
