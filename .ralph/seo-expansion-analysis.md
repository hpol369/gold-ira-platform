## KEY INSIGHT

These keywords target people in LIFE TRANSITION moments:
- Spouse just died → Widow content
- Parent needs help → Senior protection
- Worried about nursing home → Medicaid planning
- Want to help grandchildren → Legacy content
- Scared of economy → Dollar collapse / bank safety

**Life transitions = HIGH INTENT = Perfect Gold IRA prospects**

The Rich Dad angle is PERFECT:
> "The wealthy don't worry about these things because they've structured their assets differently. They own gold, silver, and real assets through Self-Directed IRAs. Here's how you can too..."
