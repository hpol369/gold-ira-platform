## CRITICAL PRIORITY - Address Immediately

### 1. "Silver IRA Rules" Cannibalization

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Search Volume:** 1,600/mo
**CPC:** $9-14

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/guide/silver-ira-rules` | Silver IRA Rules 2026: IRS Requirements, Contribution Limits & More | silver ira rules |
| `/silver-ira/rules` | Silver IRA Rules: IRS Requirements for 2026 | silver ira rules |

**Analysis:**
Both pages target the exact same keyword "silver ira rules" with nearly identical titles and content (purity requirements, contribution limits, storage rules, distribution rules, FAQs). This is the most severe cannibalization issue on the site.

**Recommendation:** **MERGE**
- Keep `/silver-ira/rules` as the canonical URL (cleaner URL structure within the silver-ira hub)
- 301 redirect `/guide/silver-ira-rules` to `/silver-ira/rules`
- Consolidate the best content from both pages into the canonical URL

---

### 2. "Silver IRA Rollover" Cannibalization

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Search Volume:** 1,300/mo
**CPC:** $12

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/guide/silver-ira-rollover` | Silver IRA Rollover Guide 2026: How to Transfer Your 401k to Silver | silver ira rollover |
| `/silver-ira/rollover` | Silver IRA Rollover: Step-by-Step Guide to Moving Your 401k (2026) | silver ira rollover |

**Analysis:**
Both pages cover the same rollover process with overlapping content (5-step process, eligible accounts, direct vs indirect rollovers, FAQs). This creates internal competition.

**Recommendation:** **MERGE**
- Keep `/silver-ira/rollover` as the canonical URL (part of organized silver-ira hub)
- 301 redirect `/guide/silver-ira-rollover` to `/silver-ira/rollover`
- Merge any unique content from the guide version

---

### 3. "Gold IRA Guide / What is a Gold IRA" Overlap

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Search Volume:** 12,100/mo combined
**CPC:** $15-22

| Page | Title | H1 | Target Keywords |
|------|-------|-----|-----------------|
| `/guide/gold-ira-guide` | Rich Dad Retirement 2026: Complete Beginner's Guide to Gold IRAs | The Complete Rich Dad Retirement for 2026 | gold ira guide, gold ira |
| `/learn/self-directed-ira-gold` | Self-Directed IRA Gold Guide (2026): Rules, Setup & Best Custodians | Self-Directed IRA Gold: The Complete 2026 Guide | self directed ira gold, gold ira |
| `/learn/gold-ira-benefits` | 7 Key Benefits of a Gold IRA in 2026 | 7 Critical Benefits of a Gold IRA | gold ira benefits |

**Analysis:**
The main gold-ira-guide and self-directed-ira-gold pages have significant overlap:
- Both explain what a gold IRA is
- Both cover the custodian/dealer/depository structure
- Both discuss IRS rules and how to open an account
- Both link to the same company reviews

**Recommendation:** **DIFFERENTIATE**
- `/guide/gold-ira-guide` - Keep as primary "gold ira" + "gold ira guide" target (beginner comprehensive guide)
- `/learn/self-directed-ira-gold` - Reposition to focus on the "self-directed" angle: comparison with regular IRAs, alternative investments beyond gold (real estate, private equity), custodian selection focus
- `/learn/gold-ira-benefits` - KEEP SEPARATE - properly targets "gold ira benefits" (different intent)
- Add canonical tags to ensure clear primary page

---

## HIGH PRIORITY

### 4. "Gold IRA Scams" + Scams Hub Overlap

**Severity:** HIGH
**Estimated Search Volume:** 2,400/mo
**CPC:** $8-12

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/learn/gold-ira-scams` | Gold IRA Scams to Avoid in 2026: Protect Your Retirement | gold ira scams |
| `/scams` | Gold IRA Scam Protection Center | Verify Before You Invest | gold ira scams |

**Analysis:**
- `/learn/gold-ira-scams` - Educational article about scam types
- `/scams` - Hub page linking to scam resources and investigations

**Recommendation:** **DIFFERENTIATE**
- `/learn/gold-ira-scams` - Keep as informational "how to avoid scams" article
- `/scams` - Rebrand title to "Gold IRA Scam Protection Hub" or "Verify Before You Invest" - focus on trust/verification tools rather than the keyword "scams"
- Ensure `/scams` links prominently to `/learn/gold-ira-scams` for detailed scam education

---

### 5. "Gold IRA Fees" + Fees Comparison Tool

**Severity:** HIGH
**Estimated Search Volume:** 3,600/mo
**CPC:** $10-14

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/guide/gold-ira-fees` | Gold IRA Fees Guide 2026: Complete Fee Breakdown & Comparison | gold ira fees |
| `/tools/fees-comparison` | Gold IRA Fees Comparison Tool 2025 | Compare Costs | gold ira fees comparison |

**Analysis:**
These pages serve different intents (guide vs tool) but both target fee-related keywords.

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE - DIFFERENTIATE**
- `/guide/gold-ira-fees` - Target "gold ira fees" (informational intent)
- `/tools/fees-comparison` - Update title year to 2026, target "gold ira fees comparison" / "gold ira fees calculator"
- Add cross-links: Guide should link to tool, tool should link to guide
- Ensure the guide focuses on education, tool focuses on interactive comparison

---

### 6. "Silver IRA" Hub vs Guide

**Severity:** HIGH
**Estimated Search Volume:** 6,600/mo
**CPC:** $12-14

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/silver-ira` | Silver IRA Hub: Complete Guide to Silver IRAs (2026) | silver ira |
| `/guide/silver-ira-guide` | Silver IRA Guide 2026: How to Invest in Silver for Retirement | silver ira guide |

**Analysis:**
- `/silver-ira` is a hub page linking to all silver IRA resources
- `/guide/silver-ira-guide` is the comprehensive educational guide

Both target "silver ira" keywords.

**Recommendation:** **DIFFERENTIATE**
- `/silver-ira` - Keep as hub/landing page (navigation-focused, shorter content)
- `/guide/silver-ira-guide` - Target "silver ira guide" / "how to invest in silver ira" (deep educational content)
- Ensure `/silver-ira` prominently links to the guide as the "Complete Guide"
- Consider renaming `/guide/silver-ira-guide` title to emphasize "How to" or "Complete Guide" differentiation

---

### 7. "401k to Gold Rollover" Coverage

**Severity:** HIGH
**Estimated Search Volume:** 4,400/mo
**CPC:** $18-22

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/guide/401k-to-gold-rollover` | 401k to Gold IRA Rollover Guide 2026: Tax-Free Transfer Steps | 401k to gold ira rollover |
| `/learn/indirect-vs-direct-rollover` | (Rollover comparison) | direct vs indirect rollover |

**Analysis:**
Currently well-differentiated. The main 401k-to-gold-rollover page targets the primary keyword while indirect-vs-direct-rollover serves a supporting role.

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Good structure
- Ensure internal linking from rollover guide to the indirect-vs-direct article
- No action needed

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 8. Company Review + Complaints Page Pattern

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Pattern Affects:** Multiple companies

Example:
| Page | Title |
|------|-------|
| `/reviews/lear-capital` | Lear Capital Review 2026: Fees, Complaints & Full Analysis |
| `/reviews/lear-capital-complaints` | Lear Capital Complaints & Lawsuit History (2026 Update) |

Also affects: American Hartford Gold, Advantage Gold, US Money Reserve, Birch Gold, Noble Gold, Goldco, Augusta, Rosland Capital

**Analysis:**
This is actually GOOD SEO strategy - the main review targets "[company] review" while the complaints page targets "[company] complaints" / "[company] lawsuit". These are different search intents.

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Intentional keyword targeting
- The main review should link to complaints page
- Complaints page should link back to full review
- This captures both positive and negative intent searchers

---

### 9. "Precious Metals IRA Rules" vs Specific Metal Rules

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Search Volume:** 720/mo

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/learn/precious-metals-ira-rules` | Precious Metals IRA Rules: IRS Regulations You Must Know (2026) | precious metals ira rules |
| `/guide/silver-ira-rules` or `/silver-ira/rules` | Silver IRA Rules... | silver ira rules |
| `/learn/gold-ira-tax-rules` | Gold IRA Tax Rules... | gold ira tax rules |

**Analysis:**
The precious-metals-ira-rules page provides umbrella coverage (gold, silver, platinum, palladium purity requirements) while metal-specific pages go deeper.

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Proper hub-and-spoke
- `/learn/precious-metals-ira-rules` - Overview/umbrella page
- Link from umbrella page to specific metal rules pages
- Ensure umbrella page focuses on what's COMMON to all metals, not duplicate metal-specific details

---

### 10. "Home Storage Gold IRA" + Checkbook IRA

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Search Volume:** 1,900/mo combined

| Page | Title |
|------|-------|
| `/learn/home-storage-gold-ira` | Home Storage Gold IRA: Why It's a Terrible Idea (2026 Warning) |
| `/learn/checkbook-ira` | Checkbook IRA page |
| `/learn/checkbook-ira-rules` | Checkbook IRA Rules page |

**Analysis:**
These topics are related (checkbook IRAs are often misused for "home storage" schemes) but have different search intents.

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE - CROSS-LINK**
- Each targets a distinct keyword
- Home storage page should link to checkbook-ira pages to explain the difference
- Checkbook IRA pages should warn about home storage misuse

---

### 11. Silver Squeeze vs Silver Shortage

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Search Volume:** 5,400/mo combined

| Page | Title | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `/silver-squeeze` | Silver Squeeze Explained: Why Banks Fear Physical Silver | silver squeeze |
| `/silver-squeeze/silver-shortage` | Silver Shortage 2026: Why Physical Silver Is Disappearing | silver shortage |

**Analysis:**
These are related but distinct topics:
- "Silver squeeze" = retail investor movement to drain supply
- "Silver shortage" = structural supply/demand imbalance

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Different intent
- Both pages properly target different keywords
- They are correctly organized as hub + subpage
- Ensure clear cross-linking between them

---

## LOW PRIORITY

### 12. Calculator Keyword Overlap (Retirement-Related)

**Severity:** LOW

The site has multiple retirement-related calculators that could potentially compete:
- `/tools/retirement-calculator`
- `/tools/retirement-spending-calculator`
- `/tools/money-longevity-calculator`
- `/tools/gold-ira-calculator`

**Analysis:**
Each calculator serves a different function and targets different keywords. The variety is a strength, not a weakness.

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Well differentiated
- Each tool serves a unique purpose
- Consider creating a "Retirement Calculators Hub" page that links to all tools

---

### 13. Silver Products/Coins Pages

**Severity:** LOW

Multiple pages about silver coins and bars:
- `/silver-ira/approved-coins`
- `/silver-retirement/ira-approved-coins`
- `/silver-retirement/ira-approved-bars`
- `/silver-products/*`
- `/silver-coin-values/*`

**Analysis:**
These pages target different intents:
- IRA-approved coins (for retirement investors)
- Silver products (for physical buyers)
- Coin values (for collectors/sellers)

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Different audience segments
- Ensure proper internal linking between related pages
- Consider consolidating `/silver-ira/approved-coins` and `/silver-retirement/ira-approved-coins` if content is nearly identical

---

### 14. Best Companies Pages

**Severity:** LOW

| Page | Title |
|------|-------|
| `/best-gold-ira-companies` | (Assumed: Best Gold IRA Companies) |
| `/best-silver-ira-companies` | (Assumed: Best Silver IRA Companies) |
| `/best-crypto-ira-companies` | (Assumed: Best Crypto IRA Companies) |
| `/silver-ira/best-company` | Best Silver IRA Company |
| `/silver-ira/companies` | Silver IRA Companies |

**Recommendation:** **DIFFERENTIATE**
- `/best-silver-ira-companies` should be the main "best silver ira companies" target (plural, listicle)
- `/silver-ira/best-company` should target "best silver ira company" (singular, recommendation)
- `/silver-ira/companies` should be reframed as "compare" rather than "best"
