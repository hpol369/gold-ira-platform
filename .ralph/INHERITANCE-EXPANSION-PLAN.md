| inheriting-401k-from-parent | 30 | 1 | - |

**Total Search Volume: 460/month**
**Average Difficulty: 1.1 (extremely easy to rank)**

## Execution Strategy

Split into 2 agents to avoid token limits:

### Agent I1: Dollar Amount Articles (4 articles)
- what-to-do-with-50k-inheritance
- what-to-do-with-150k-inheritance
- what-to-do-with-300k-inheritance
- what-to-do-with-400k-inheritance

### Agent I2: Inheritance Process Articles (3 articles)
- inheritance-financial-advisor
- inheriting-ira-from-parent
- inheriting-401k-from-parent

### Agent I3: Integration
- Add imports to index.ts
- Verify TypeScript compilation
- Run build check

## Gold Bridge Messaging
- Inheritance is a one-time windfall - protect purchasing power
- Many inherit during market peaks (bad timing for stocks)
- Gold provides immediate inflation protection
- 10-15% allocation recommended
- Tax advantages when rolling inherited IRA to Gold IRA

## File Structure
```
src/data/learn-articles/
├── inheritance-expansion-cluster.ts (Agent I1 + I2 combined)
└── index.ts (updated by Agent I3)
```

## Expected Outcome
- 7 new zero-diff articles
- ~460 monthly search volume captured
- Strong internal linking to existing inheritance-windfall articles
